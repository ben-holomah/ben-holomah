## Hi there, I'm Ben! 👋


I am currently a senior at Towson University studying Information technology, specializing in Network Security.

As an aspiring Cybersecurity Professional I’m currently deep-diving into the world of SOC operations and GRC frameworks. My GitHub is a living portfolio of my journey, featuring hands-on labs in Virtual Machine, network defense, and data analytics.

I am currently focused on bridging the gap between my academic studies and real-world application by refining my skills in automation and infrastructure security.
